# Prerequisites and requirements

===

## Lecture

The lecture focuses on **Julia**, **Python**, and **C++** as programming languages suitable for scientific programming.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While **prior knowledge** in any programming language is a plus, it is **not a prerequisite**.

---

## Lab

In the lab you will be given the opportunity to acquire or intensify your programming knowledge on a programming project of your choice.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ambition of the project should match your prior knowledge.

---

## E-Assignments

On https://e-assignments.net you will find a collection of self-study exercises, helping you to learn how to implement solutions for common tasks in business analytics and data science.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must use your KLU email address to register.

---

## Grading

Grading will be based to 100% on project work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your project work will only be graded if you have successfully completed **at least 50% of the e-Assignments**.

---

## Bonus

A bonus of up to **1.0 point on the final course grade** can be obtained by meaningful contributions to the course materials. 

---

### Contributing via Issues and Pull Requests (PR)

A typical workflow to contribute on [GitHub](]https://github.com/rajgoel/course-scientific-programming) is:

- Create an **Issue**
- Comment on existing issues
- **Fork** the repository 
- Create a new **Branch** in your fork for your fix or feature
- Submit a **Pull Request**

> [!NOTE]
> For minor fixes (e.g., typos), a **Pull Request** may be submitted directly without creating an issue.

---

### Contributing via Discussions

The course also benefits from discussions:

- Start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/rajgoel/course-scientific-programming/discussions)
- Participate in existing discussions
- Link discussions to issues or pull requests where relevant.

---

### Eligibility for bonus

All **Pull Requests** that are merged are eligible for a bonus. Depending on the quality and impact, the following may also be eligible: 

- **Pull Requests** that are rejected  
  *Example:* A PR that fixes an issue but is not merged because another approach to fix the issue is taken.
- **Issues**  
  *Example:* Reporting an issue that ultimately leads to improvements.
- **Discussions**  
  *Example:* Starting or participating in a discussion helping clarify course content.

## Software and tools

---

### Command line/terminal

The command line is a text-based interface that allows users to interact directly with the operating system by typing commands. 

- **Windows:** Open *PowerShell*
- **MacOS/Linux:** Open *Terminal*

> [!NOTE]
> The command line can be used to install software and to run development tools such as Julia, Git, and many others. 

---

### Julia

Julia is the main programming language used in this course. Install it following the instructions at: https://julialang.org/install/

---

### Python

To experiment with Python, you can use the online interpreter available at: https://www.online-python.com/

---

### C++

To experiment with C++, you can use the online compiler available at: https://www.onlinegdb.com/

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to select *Language: C++23*

---

### Git

Git is a version control system used to track changes in code and collaborate with others.

- Follow the instructions on https://git-scm.com/downloads to install git on your computer.

> [!NOTE]
> Git is the software used by platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

---

You can use git via the command line.

Common commands include:

```plaintext
git clone <repository-url>          # copy a repository to your local machine
git checkout -b <branch-name>       # create and switch to a new branch
git add <file>                      # stage changes to be committed
git commit -m "your commit message" # save staged changes with a descriptive message
git push -u origin <branch-name>    # upload committed changes to the remote repository and set upstream branch
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can find comprehensive guides for Git and GitHub [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/ultimate-guide-git-github/) and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp?remote=github).

## Project

---

The project is the core component of this course and determines your final grade.

---

### Group work

Projects are carried out in groups of 3â€“5 students. 

Each group will collaboratively plan, implement, document, test, and present a scientific programming project.

---

### Topic

The topic of the project is self-selected and should solve a problem relevant to business analytics ad data science. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The topic must be approved by the instructor.


---

### Programming language

The primary language for the project must be **Julia**.

---

### GitHub

All projects must be hosted on GitHub. 

Group members are expected to use branches, commits, and pull requests to manage and track changes collaboratively.

---

### Evaluation criteria

The project will be assessed based on the following criteria:

- **Project ambition**  
  Complexity and scope of the selected topic
- **Implementation quality**  
  Correctness, structure, and completeness of the code
- **Documentation**  
  Clarity, completeness, and usability of the project documentation
- **Test coverage**  
  Evidence of adequate testing to ensure code quality

---

### Project presentation

In the last session of the course, each group will present their project to the class.

The presentation should:

- Explain the problem being solved
- Demonstrate the implemented solution
- Highlight technical challenges and key design decisions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The presentation is part of the final project grade.


---

### Peer evaluation

**Before the last session**, each group member must submit a [peer evaluation form](peer_evaluation.md) to reflect on the contributions of others in the group.

---

### Individual evaluation

Each student will be evaluated individually considering:

- The overall project evaluation
- The individual contribution to the repository (e.g., commits, issues, pull requests)
- Implemented features and their relevance or difficulty
- Peer evaluation
