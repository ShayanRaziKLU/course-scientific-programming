### Contributing via Issues and Pull Requests (PR)

A typical workflow to contribute is:

- Create an **Issue** in the [GitHub repository](]https://github.com/rajgoel/course-scientific-programming) describing a problem, suggestion, or improvement.
- Comment on existing issues with helpful information that aids in clarifying or closing the issue.
- Fork the repository and implement a fix or enhancement addressing an issue.
- Submit a **Pull Request** referencing the related issue.

For minor fixes (e.g., typos), a **Pull Request** may be submitted directly without creating an issue.

---

### Contributing via Discussions

The course also benefits from discussions:

- Start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/rajgoel/course-scientific-programming/discussions) to propose ideas or ask questions.
- Participate in existing discussions by providing constructive feedback or suggestions.
- Discussions that lead to improvements in the course materials may be linked to issues or pull requests for implementation.

---

### Eligibility for bonus

All **Pull Requests** that are merged are eligible for a bonus. Depending on the quality and impact, the following may also be eligible: 

- **Pull Requests** that are rejected, e.g., a PR that fixes an issue but is not merged because another approach to fix the issue is taken.
- **Issues**, e.g., reporting an issue that ultimately leads to improvements.
- **Discussions**, e.g., starting or participating in a discussion helping clarify course content.
