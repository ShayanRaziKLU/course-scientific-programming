## Basic data types

---

Computers store data as sequences of binary digits (bits), grouped into blocks of fixed size (e.g., 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits).

---

### Unsigned integers

A non-negative whole number (an unsigned integer) is stored using its binary representation, where each bit represents a power of 2. 

**For example:**
An 8-bit representation of the number 42 is:

<div data-load="02-lecture/uint8.svg">
</div>


---

A non-negative whole number is stored in its binary represenation.
