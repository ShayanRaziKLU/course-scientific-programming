> [!WARNING]
> Not yet complete

---

Errors are inevitable. 


---

- Failing silently should be avoided
- Validate before use
- Meaningful crashes

---

## Errors vs. exceptions

- certain errors occur routinely and a program shall be able to deal with it or even recover
- other errors may be such that  a program can/should not recover

---

## Try/catch
